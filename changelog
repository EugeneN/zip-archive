zip-archive 0.2.3.1

  * Require binary >= 0.7 and directory >= 1.2.  The newer binary
    is needed to provide toArchiveOrFail.  The other change is
    mainly for convenience, to avoid lots of ugly conditional
    compilation.

zip-archive 0.2.3

  * Export new function `toArchiveOrFail`.  Closes #17.
  * Set general purpose bit flag to use UTF8 in local file header.
    Otherwise we get a mismatch between the flag in the central
    directory and the flag in the local file header, which causes some
    programs not to be able to extract the files.  Closes #19.

zip-archive 0.2.2.1

  * Fix a stack overflow in getWordsTillSig (Tristan Ravitch).

zip-archive 0.2.2

  * Set bit 11 in the file header to ensure other programs
    recognize UTF-8 encoded file names (Tobias Brandt).

zip-archive 0.2.1

  * Added OptLocation, to specify the path to which a file
    is to be added when readEntry is used (Stephen McIntosh).
